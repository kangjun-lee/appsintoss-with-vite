# TDS Mobile Design System

## Introduction

TDS is a comprehensive design system used across Toss products. The system comprises "hundreds of components and templates that extend beyond design tools to function as a unified design language connecting design and development."

## Core Goals

The TDS initiative pursues three primary objectives:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures consistent UI standards across all Toss products, maintaining minimum quality benchmarks through systematic component usage.

2. **Productivity Enhancement**: Streamlines UI development by providing reusable, well-designed components that enable teams to "focus on problem-solving rather than interface creation."

3. **Excellence in Execution**: Aims to achieve industry-leading product polish through standardized interactions, animations, illustrations, and design templates.

## System Structure

The design system is organized into several sections:

- **Foundation**: Colors and Typography specifications
- **Components**: Over 40 UI components ranging from Badge and Button to complex patterns like Dialog, ListRow, and TextField variants
- **Utilities**: Overlay extensions and hooks for enhanced functionality
- **Migration Guides**: Resources for upgrading between versions

## Navigation

The documentation provides access to component specifications, implementation guides, and upgrade paths for developers maintaining Toss products.
